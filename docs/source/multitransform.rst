Multi Transform
===============

The **Multi Transform** panel provides a powerful and precise way to manipulate the position, rotation, and scale of multiple objects simultaneously. It's designed for workflows that demand accurate, numeric input, offering a level of control that goes beyond Blender's standard interactive tools.

The panel is organized into three rows for **Position**, **Rotation**, and **Scale**, each with its own numeric input fields and a **Set** button to apply the changes. These rows share a set of powerful controls that define how the transformations are applied, allowing the tool to operate in two distinct ways: a **Standard Mode** for editing objects independently, and a powerful **Active Leads Mode** which uses the active object as a group pivot.

UI Controls Explained
---------------------

* **Affect: X, Y, Z:** These checkboxes let you apply transforms to specific axes while ignoring others.
* **Set Button:** Applies the values from the numeric fields to all selected objects, respecting the mode settings.
* **Set All Button:** Applies the values for Position, Rotation, and Scale all at once.
* **Pos, Rot, Scale Buttons:** These are shortcuts to reset the numeric input fields next to them to their default valuesâ€”``(0,0,0)`` for Position/Rotation and ``(1,1,1)`` for Scale.
* **Relative Toggle:** Switches between **Absolute** and **Relative** modes. Its behavior changes depending on whether **Active Leads** is enabled.
* **Active Leads Toggle:** Switches the tool to a powerful mode where the **active object** acts as a pivot or "fake parent" for the rest of the selection.

Standard Modes (Active Leads OFF)
---------------------------------

When **Active Leads** is disabled, the tool operates on each selected object independently.

* **Absolute Mode** (``Relative`` disabled): This mode sets the transform values to the **exact numbers** you enter. It's perfect for aligning objects to a specific coordinate.
    * *Example: To align all selected objects to a height of 5 meters, you would disable ``Relative``, enter ``5.0`` in the Z position field, and click **Set**.*

* **Relative Mode** (``Relative`` enabled): This mode **adds** (or multiplies for scale) the entered values to each object's current transform. It's ideal for nudging a selection of objects while preserving their existing arrangement.
    * *Example: To move all selected objects 2 units to the right, you would enable ``Relative``, enter ``2.0`` in the X position field, and click **Set**.*

Active Leads Mode (Active Leads ON)
-----------------------------------

Enabling **Active Leads** makes the **active object** the pivot point for the entire selection, like a lead dancer guiding their partners. The ``Relative`` toggle now switches between two powerful sub-modes.

Absolute Mode (Relative OFF): Transform as Children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, the entire selection behaves as if temporarily parented to the active object. You are setting an **absolute target** for the leader, and the followers will arrange themselves around it.

* **Position:** The entire group moves rigidly to place the active object at the target coordinates.
* **Rotation:** Followers **orbit** around the active object as it rotates to its new orientation.
* **Scale:** Followers move closer to or further away from the active object as it scales to its new size, maintaining the group's proportions.

Relative Mode (Relative ON): Incremental Parented Transform
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this mode, the UI values represent an **incremental change** that is applied to the active object, and the followers move with it in a parented fashion with each click.

* **Position:** The entire group moves by the specified amount.
* **Rotation:** The active object rotates on its axis by the specified degrees, and all followers **orbit** it by that same amount.
* **Scale:** The active object is scaled by the specified factor, and all followers scale with it, moving further from or closer to the leader proportionally.
