About
=====

Precise tools is founded by Jeroen Backx, a professional 3d artist and game developer at a game studio in the Netherlands. Precise tools were initially developed to improve practical workflows for the teams which worked with Jeroen but now grew into addons to serve the wider 3d artist community.

We hope you enjoy the addons, may they help you boost your productivity and creativity to new heights!
