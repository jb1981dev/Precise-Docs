Blender Menus
==============

This section provides convenient access to some of Blender's powerful, but sometimes hard-to-find, native menus and operators. It brings useful tools directly into the Instance Wrangler workflow, saving you from having to remember keyboard shortcuts.

The buttons in this section are only active when you have at least one object selected.

Link/Transfer
-------------

*Shortcut:* :kbd:`Ctrl+L`

This button opens Blender's native **Link/Transfer Data** menu. While the addon's own **Link Selected** tool is powerful for converting and linking object data, this menu provides many other advanced linking options, including the ability to link:

* Materials
* Animation Data
* Collection membership
* Fonts & Textures
* and more...

Select Grouped
--------------

*Shortcut:* :kbd:`Shift+G`

This button opens Blender's **Select Grouped** menu. It provides various ways to expand your selection based on the properties of the active object. This is a powerful tool for quickly selecting objects that are related, for example by:

* Collection
* Object Type
* Object Data
* Parent, Children, etc.
